for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.textContent = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    document.body.appendChild(newElement);
}

Reflect

Is this for loop code written efficiently? Write out the different ways you think this code could be improved. (hint - there are actually several ways!)

Your reflection

Maybe move somethings out of the loop like document.body.appendChild();?
Things to think about
Thanks for your response!


Answer:

const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();  // ← uses a DocumentFragment instead of a <div>

for (let i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
    const newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.innerText = 'This is paragraph number ' + i;

    fragment.appendChild(newElement);
}

document.body.appendChild(fragment); // reflow and repaint here -- once!

document.Fragment makes it a little bit faster.
